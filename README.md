# Autobot_Jarvis | Virtual Assitant

Jarvis is a virtual assistant made famous by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

To create a virtual assistant like Jarvis using Python, one can use several libraries and APIs that enable natural language processing, speech recognition, and text-to-speech conversion. For example, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library can be used for natural language processing, and the Google Speech API can be used for speech recognition.

You have to install all required libarires from the python website.
Example : pip install "Library_name" -> Enter.

You can add or delete function according to your choice.

Thank you.
